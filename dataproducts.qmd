# Video Data

All video data and spreadsheet export from parent-report questionnaires will be openly shared on Databrary at the project end. Full videos from exemplar home visits in [South Korea](https://nyu.databrary.org/volume/1745/slot/72037/-) and [Hong Kong and China](https://nyu.databrary.org/volume/1611) are publicly available. Curated clips and excerpts will be shared on the new "BABIESbrary" searchable global library created as part of this project.

All videos that are collected with go through a quality assurance (QA) process in which the BABIES team will ensure that participants meet inclusion criteria and protocol adhered to, such that videos are eligible to be included in the final sample. Videos that don't pass QA may be reused for other purposes, and as needed, the collection site will be provided additional training.

## Natural activities

Data collectors film one hour of natural activity, while mothers and babies go about their day. Videos contain faces and voices on camera. Mothers may go anywhere in their home, play with their babies or not, do chores, work, and bath, feed, or change their child.

# Language Translations & Cultural Adaptations

## Assessing vocabulary of dual language learners

As part of the NIH [PLAY Project](play-project.org), a method for addressing gaps in the assessment of dual-language learning infants was developed. The method for developing the vocabulary inventory and product are reported are shared on [this Databrary volume](https://nyu.databrary.org/volume/1168).
