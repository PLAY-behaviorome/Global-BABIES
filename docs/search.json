    "text": "Global BABIES (Babies’ Activities & Behaviors In Everyday Settings) will revolutionize the ecological validity, cultural diversity, global practice, and transparency of developmental science:\n(1) We will establish the first global video corpus of everyday activity and behavior in 1000+ mothers and infants in the natural home environment—capturing practices for childrearing, nurturing, and interacting with infants. We will collect 3D renderings of the home environment, indoors and out (including cultural artifacts, technologies, and educational materials). Building on our NIH-funded work across the United States (play-project.org) and partnering with experts at global sites, we will conduct Global BABIES with total transparency and reproducibility, using video as the medium to document everything—including training videos, fidelity to the protocol, and quality assurance. All videos of home visits and supporting materials will be openly shared with researchers worldwide on Databrary, the world’s only large-scale video repository.\n(2) We will build “BABIESbrary,” a searchable, expandable global library of curated, video clips relevant to infant learning, development, and well-being, including infant-caregiver behavior, everyday activities, and home environments across the globe in a separately branded sector of Databrary. Identification of video clips for BABIESbrary, and decisions about content and search terms will be developed with user communities to ensure cultural relevance. We will extend the Databrary infrastructure, access model, and policy framework to allow new user communities (e.g., community and technical colleges) to access BABIESbrary for research, teaching, and practice to ensure that BABIESbrary has wide reach to inform the global science of human flourishing.\n(3) We will collaboratively build capacity by training local researchers and practitioners on the equitable, open sharing of video for research, teaching, demonstration, and practice. Training will include use of Databrary and BABIESbrary for uploading new material and finding data and video clips for reuse, video recording of behavior and home settings, human video annotation and transcription with Datavyu (an open-source, computerized coding tool), quality assurance and reproducibility, inter-observer reliability, self-curation, and transparent documentation of research protocols.\n\nOur Vision\nUnderstanding the developmental foundation of human intelligence and flourishing requires observations of babies’ natural activities and behaviors in everyday settings. Infancy is a critical time. Babies’ brains, bodies, and behaviors develop at unprecedented rates, and each change expands opportunities for learning. Infants everywhere acquire foundational skills for moving their bodies, exploring the world, thinking and planning, interacting with others, and forming emotional attachments. And they do so in the context of culturally diverse childrearing practices and everyday settings. However, researchers lack objective, empirical data about cultural variations in childrearing environments—data possible only through video observations of mother-infant behavior in the natural home environments where families live and children develop. In child development, video-based, research on childrearing practices is common, but it is overly reliant on data from the Global North. High-quality video data on childrearing practices around the world in the home setting are critical to understand the unique experiences of infants and mothers from cultures around the world.\nWe will use video to document and explain the critical cultural contributions of childrearing practices around the globe to infant learning and development. We will create the first large-scale, global, video corpus of infant-mother everyday activities and behaviors in the home environment—openly shared with researchers worldwide. And we will build curated videoclip libraries to share examples of potentially beneficial childrearing practices for research, teaching, and intervention. Video is the most powerful, widely available, and intuitively accessible medium to document the richness and complexity of behavior and the subtle details of the surrounding context. Large-scale video is amenable to human annotation and machine learning. However, the use of video across global user communities requires the digital infrastructure, ethical policy framework, and training of local personnel to collect, curate, and share video at scale. We will leverage the power of video to galvanize the global science of infant learning and development.\n\n\nCommitment to Open Science\nThe openly-shared, global video corpus and materials will accelerate research and facilitate discovery by allowing researchers around the globe (many from under-resourced institutions) to reuse data on infant-mother natural activity and behavior in the ecologically-valid, home environment, and to adapt protocols for new studies of diverse cultural communities. The videoclips in BABIESbrary will illustrate unique cultural practices and home environments to train the next generation of scientists in open science and diversity."

Try to ignore me as much as possible and I will stay out of the way. I will also try not to respond to you and [CHILD] so that he/she is not distracted. You can go anywhere in your home but we just ask you to remain indoors. You can play together or not, you can do chores, watch TV, talk on the phone, give him/her a bath or snack. The idea is to capture what your typical day is like. And as a reminder, I’m just here to record so you will be in charge of [CHILD]’s safety.\nPoint the camera at the child and start timing for the one-hour natural activity video.\n\nAim to get 60 minutes of uninterrupted natural activity, in addition to the time you take to give instructions. The natural activity should comprise a single recording; not piecemeal recordings that add up to 60 minutes.\nKeep the camera on the child at all times. Specifically, ensure that the child’s whole body is visible on camera. If mom is in frame, capture as much of her body as possible without compromising the view of the child.\nRecord in front or to the side of the child as much as possible.\nDo not zoom in.\nAlways try to stay toward the edge of rooms and doorways. You do not want to influence child to interact with you, or get in child’s way.\nRemain at as far a distance as possible (~3 to 5 m, hugging the wall) so that the child is not distracted by your presence.\nDo not interact with the child or make eye contact with the child. Just watch through the viewfinder of the camera.\nThe child does not need to be happy or engaged with the mom; the mom does not need to play with or consistently interact with the child. They can turn on TV, music, phones, or other devices. She can make a phone or video call. In short, they can both do whatever they want for 1 hour.\nIf the mom talks about your presence (even to discourage child from interacting) more than 3 times, after the third time Say: Why don’t we pretend I’m not here.\nIf mom asks to pause the camera (to change or feed), ask for permission to record from behind Say: Is it okay to keep the camera running and I’ll film you from behind? . Otherwise, keep the camera running and film the floor to continue capturing audio Say: Can I keep the camera running and just film the floor?\nIf something happens within the first 10mins of the recording that is a protocol violation (e.g., dad returns home and interacts with the mom or child; camera battery dies), restart the 1 hour recording in full (rather than adding more time at the end).\nIf something happens within the final minutes of the recording that is a protocol violation (e.g., child starts to fall asleep, mother in law enters the room they are in), keep recording and finish out the 60 minutes. Enough of the visit may still be usable to pass quality assurance.\n\nAt the end of the one-hour recording, Say: Great, we are done with the one-hour recording!\nStop recording"

Is it okay to record this room anyway? If the mom does not give permission to record a room, for instance, the grandmother is sleeping in there, that is okay; please say to the camera in English about the mom asking you not to film there and why.\nStop recording\n\n\n3D rendering\n\nSetup and pair Matterport\nRemove Matterport components from the case and assemble, ensuring camera is stable and tightened on the mount and that the camera is level. Turn on Matterport and wait until broadcast signal turns yellow and blinks.\nGo to WiFi settings on phone or digital device and select Matterport. NOTE: Your device should be paired with Matterport prior to visit, while in the lab. Make sure broadcast signal on Matterport stops blinking (this means it is paired).\n\n\nMove room to room and take digital mapping\n\nPlan route through home (you should have gotten an idea from the house walkthrough).\nTake at least 3 measurements of each room until spaces on device show they have been captured (take more measurements for larger and connecting rooms).\nBe strategic about where you start in each room, and be sure to only move the camera ~2m between scans.\nIf you haven’t captured a given region it will show up as blacked out on your device\nIf you need to readjust the height of the Matterport tripod, you can easily do so.
