## Prepare to be in the home

1.  Take your own water with you. For the duration of the visit, you will decline any offerings of food or drink.
2.  Plan your bathroom breaks around the visit (it will be approx 2 hrs long).
3.  Take your university ID with you, be prepared to show it if asked.
4.  Dress plainly, modestly, neutrally. Nothing too bright and attractive to children. Avoid strong perfumes and noisy jewelry. The idea is to blend into the background as much as possible. Try not to wear all black either.

# Home Visit

At the end of every home visit (for each participant), researchers will upload the following:

-   **exactly 4 videos** (to their site's Databrary volume)\
      - One-hour natural activity\
      - House walkthrough (include: sleeping arrangements, clothing, books, toys)\
      - 3D rendering\
      - Questionnaires (set up camera on tripod, focus on mom)

-   **exactly 1 CAD file from Matterport** (to their site's Databrary volume)

-   **exactly 3 questionnaire files** (through the KoBo Toolbox app)\
      - demographics questionnaire\
      - home visit questionnaire\
      - post-visit notes

## 1. Arrival & introduction

*Experimenters should always act in a professional and respectful manner when interacting with the participants and while in the home. Do not make comments or react to anything in front of the mom to make her feel uncomfortable. All families should feel that their participation in the study is meaningful.*

Say: [Hi, my name is \[NAME\] and I'm visiting from \[INSTITUTION\]. Thanks for letting us come to your home today!]{.say}

Ask if you should take your shoes off.\
- Ask for good place (i.e. out of child's reach) to put backpack and coat.\
- Do not leave the tripod and other equipment lying around.\
- Do not engage or warm up to the baby. Just need to make mom feel comfortable.

## 2. Consent to participate

Experimenter should explain the study and ask mom to sign the consent.

Say: [*"The visit has a few parts. I'll begin by video-recording you and \[CHILD\] as you go about your day. I will video-record you both for one hour. Afterwards, I'll ask you to give me a walk-through of your home that I will record on video to get a sense of the places \[CHILD\] goes and things that he/she plays with. I'll also be taking a digital measurement of your home. Finally, I will ask you some general questions about your family and home, and about \[CHILD\]'s skills and routines. Everything will be video-recorded and the visit will last for no more than three hours. You will receive compensation for your participation at the end. Do you have any questions? Okay, great. Here is the consent form that explains everything I just said. Please read it through and then print and sign your name on the back."*]{style="color: blue"}

## 3. One-hour natural activity

[*Begin recording*]{style="color: orange"}

Say: [*"For the next hour, do anything you would typically do as if I weren't here. Try to ignore me as much as possible and I will stay out of the way. I will also try not to respond to you and \[CHILD\] so that he/she is not distracted. You can go anywhere in your home but we just ask you to remain indoors. You can play together or not, you can do chores, watch TV, talk on the phone, give him/her a bath or snack. The idea is to capture what your typical day is like. And as a reminder, I'm just here to record so you will be in charge of \[CHILD\]'s safety."*]{style="color: blue"}

Point the camera at the child and start timing for the one-hour natural activity video.

-   Aim to get 60 minutes of uninterrupted natural activity recoding, in addition to the time you take to give instructions

-   Keep the camera on the child at all times. Specifically, ensure that the child's whole body is visible on camera. If mom is in frame, capture as much of her body as possible without compromising the view of the child.

-   Record in front or to the side of the child as much as possible.

-   Do not zoom in.

-   Always try to stay toward the edge of rooms and doorways. You do not want to influence child to interact with you, or get in child's way.

-   Remain at as far a distance as possible (\~3 to 5 m, hugging the wall) so that the child is not distracted by your presence.

-   Do not interact with the child or make eye contact with the child. Just watch through the viewfinder of the camera.

-   If the mom talks about your presence (even to discourage child from interacting) more than 3 times, after the third time Say: [*"Why don't we pretend I'm not here."*]{style="color: blue"}

-   If mom asks to pause the camera (to change or feed), ask for permission to record from behind Say: [*"Is it okay to keep the camera running and I'll film you from behind?"*]{style="color: blue"} . Otherwise, keep the camera running and film the floor to continue capturing audio Say: [*"Can I keep the camera running and just film the floor?"*]{style="color: blue"}

At the end of the one-hour recording, Say: [*"Great, we are done with the one-hour recording!"*]{style="color: blue"}

[*Stop recording*]{style="color: orange"}

## 4. Home environment

### House walkthrough

[*Begin recording*]{style="color: orange"}

Say: [*"Now, we would like to see the space that \[CHILD\] gets to explore throughout the day. Please walk me through your home as I follow with a camera. As we walk around, please show me where you keep any objects --- toys, books, sippy cups, anything like that --- that \[CHILD\] might interact with. Please show me where he/she sleep, and where you keep his/her clothes and shoes to give us an idea of the kinds of things he/she wears."*]{style="color: blue"}

## Questionnaires

Text: We ask parents in person. Questionnaires based on adaptations conducted in collaboration with our partners. Demographics, health (breastfeeding), household roster & childcare arrangements, child vocabulary, was it a typical day. Use a box such as in PLAY to list the type of questions we will ask. Post visit notes.

Cut all the subheads of 6.1 onward; possibly replace with questionnaires from HK and South Korea?
