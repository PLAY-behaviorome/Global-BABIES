title: "The Sample"
---

Each Global BABIES site is responsible for outreach to their community to enroll interested families, visits home to film mother-child natural activity, and upload videos to their Databrary volume---with each site collecting data from 100 mother-child pairs. The final sample will contain 1000+ hours of mother-child activity, house tours, 3D renderings of the home, and parent-report questionnaires.

# The Sites

The full corpus will be openly shared on [Databrary](databrary.org). Excerpt visits are currently available on the [Global BABIES Databrary volume](https://nyu.databrary.org/volume/1745).

Yellow markers indicate proposed future Global BABIES sites---previous research partners of the leadership team.

# Inclusion Criteria

Although Global BABIES endeavors to sample as much of the rich variations that the collection sites present. To ensure a sufficient sample size, we will limit variability along several dimensions. To be included in the final sessions, participants must:\
- be between 11-25 months of age\
- be born full-term (at last 36 weeks), of normal birth weight (\>= 5.5 lbs), without known disabilities\
- have the mother act as the caregiver during the one hour of natural activity

Participant families will vary widely on all other measures including race, ethnicity, home language, religion, urban/rural/suburban residence, and developing nation status.
